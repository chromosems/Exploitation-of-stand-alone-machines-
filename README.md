# HACKING ASTAND-ALONE MACHINE

## Objective

The objective was to capture the flag and gain access to the machine through a shell.

### Skills Learned
- Vulnerability  Assessment.
- Exploitation Development.
- Operating system and software knwolwedgge.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Nmap to run the IP address of the machine for vulnerablities.
- File Transfer protocol , used to identify files.
- Hash identifier, to identify the has type .
- Hashcat to crack passwords
- Ffuf to perform directoory busting
- running reverse shell to listen

## Steps
- Running nmap to generate and identify vulnerabilities in the machine, to do so, nmap -T4 -p- -A  thus sets the timing level to 4 and p scans all ports and A enhances aggressive scanning

*Ref 1: after the scan, noticed a file note.txt which was of interest*
- Calling out the note.txt file and run the file transfer protocol with the Ip address to access the file

*Ref 2: image running ftp 192.168.250.134*
- Next cat the note.txt to view the file

*Ref 3: screenshot shows using the student regNo and the hashed password*
- With the given studentID,  its visible except the Hash, next dentify the hashcat given using hash-identifier by simply posting the hash

*Ref 4: Hash-identifier suggests the hash is MD5*
- With help from https://www.4armed.com/blog/hashcat-crack-md5-hashes/, Next was to locate rockyou.txt which comes installed in kali linux
- <img width="399" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chromosems/Exploitation-of-stand-alone-machines-/assets/44053943/370a6168-8e3a-4616-8cc2-114782eb5d71">
*Ref 5: The format and syntax  for running command*
- As seen in the syntax above, i created hashes.txt file for the MD5 hash captured earlier
- <img width="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chromosems/Exploitation-of-stand-alone-machines-/assets/44053943/4389dd3e-d60c-4879-8288-d1f6f54ee95d">
*Ref 6: Hashes.txt file*
- I then replaced the hashes with hashes.txt in the code syntax, then run the hash against rockyou.txt which consists of a list of commonly used passwords to attempt to crack the hash

*Ref 7: screenshot shows password in plain text hence cracked*
- Next, was to figure out where to login and use the obtained credentials,  using Ffuf to perform directory bursting to identify possible login site

*Ref 8:  using medium.txt directory list to process faster and FUZZ to identify any security flaws and as aresult  got the academy and phpmyadmin url*
- The Academy seemed to fit the describe of the login details
-  <img width="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chromosems/Exploitation-of-stand-alone-machines-/assets/44053943/fe835bb7-fae1-4528-83f3-23ae6ea7899a">
*Ref 9: after login notice it prompts to change the logins details however it also points out image upload and exploiting the upload for vulnerabilities was next*

- Started by running php reverse shell https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.ph then upload it as image

*Ref 10: file uploaded to image*
- Before uploading the file,  set a listening session  where the shell will be generated

*Ref 10: Here the shell is generated and  whoami  provides source hence the upload was vuulnerable and the attack was succesful*
