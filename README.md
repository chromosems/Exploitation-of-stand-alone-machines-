# HACKING ASTAND-ALONE MACHINE

## Objective

The objective was to capture the flag and gain access to the machine through a shell.

### Skills Learned
- Vulnerability  Assessment.
- Exploitation Development.
- Operating system and software knwolwedgge.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Nmap to run the IP address of the machine for vulnerablities.
- File Transfer protocol , used to identify files.
- Hash identifier, to identify the has type .
- Hashcat to crack passwords
- Ffuf to perform directoory busting
- running reverse shell to listen

## Steps
- Running nmap to generate and identify vulnerabilities in the machine, to do so, nmap -T4 -p- -A  thus sets the timing level to 4 and p scans all ports and A enhances aggressive scanning

*Ref 1: after the scan, noticed a file note.txt which was of interest*
- therefore, calling out the note.txt file will run the file transfer protocol with the Ip address to access the file

*Ref 2: image running ftp 192.168.250.134*
- Next cat the note.txt to view/read the file

*Ref 3: screenshot inoforms i can use the student reg no and we also the hashed password*
-  with the given studentID, the studentID is visible except the Hash, next will i dentify the hashcat given using hash-identifier by simply pasting the hash

*Ref 4: Hash-identifier suggests the hash is MD5*
- with help from https://www.4armed.com/blog/hashcat-crack-md5-hashes/, i was able to locate rockyou.txt which come installed in kali linux
- <img width="399" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chromosems/Exploitation-of-stand-alone-machines-/assets/44053943/370a6168-8e3a-4616-8cc2-114782eb5d71">
*Ref 5: the format and syntax  for running command*
- As seen in the syntax above, i created hashes.txt file for the MD5 hash captured earlier
- <img width="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chromosems/Exploitation-of-stand-alone-machines-/assets/44053943/4389dd3e-d60c-4879-8288-d1f6f54ee95d">
*Ref 6: Hashes.txt file*
- I then replaced the hashes with hashes.txt in the code syntax, then run the hash against rockyou.txt which consists of a list of commonly used passwords to attempt to crack the hash

*Ref 7: screenshot shows password in plain text hence cracked*
- Next, i had to figure out where to login and use the obtained credentials, so i used Ffuf to perform directory bursting to identify possible loogin site

*Ref 8: i used medium.txt directory list to process faster and FUZZ to identify any security flaws and as aresult i got academy and phpmyadmin*
- the Academy seems to fit the describe of the login details there

*Ref 9: after login notice it prompts to change the logins however it also points out image upload and i did exploit the upload for vulnerabilities*

- Started by running php reverse shell https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.ph then upload it as image

*Ref 10: file uploaded to image*
- before i uploaded the file, i set a listening session and where the shell will be generated

*Ref 10: here the shell is generated and when you run whoami it provides source hence the upload was vuulnerable and the attack was succesful*
